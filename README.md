# CaesarCipher
Small project to encode, decode and to perform cryptoanalysis the given text with the given key (shift to given number of symbols).
Just to demonstrate the coding and decoding of a text in Russian, the first two paragraphs of 'Mumu' novel by I.Turgenev was to encrypt, decrypt and to perform brute-orce analysis with the shift of symbols accroding to given number of symbols. It is intended to improve the code to implement more complex ciphering/deciphering techniques on this repository to try the encryption domain.
